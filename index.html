Scikit-learn: open source Python machine learning community

- Scikit-learn:
    - intro broader PyData ecosystem
    - core component, extremely valuable for a lot of research
    - some usage statistics etc?

- Contributions to scikit-learn in Université Paris Saclay, eg:
    - Doctoral missions supported by digicosme on scikit-learn
        - doctoral missiong on loky, funded by Digicosme, leading to important improvements in scikit-learn and even to upstream in Python 3.7
        - other doctoral missions
    - our contributions (ColumnTransformer?)

- Open source workflow:
    - narrative of contributions
    - summary slide: Open source: software engineering best practices
        (Version control, Bug tracker, Code review, Continuous integreation, Code quality)
    - valuable skill learned during doctoral missions

- More on open source community
    - Core open source software projects -> important for ecosystem, but underdevopled (thé picture)
    - point of view of maintainer (I have this for pandas, don't think that this is a problem since for sklearn is probably very similar)
    - How can you contribute?

# Scikit-learn: the vision

1. Machine learning for everybody and for everything
2. Machine learning without learning the machinery

# Scikit-learn in numbers

<center>

![:scale 100%](img/stats.png)

* Almost 1,100 contributors
* Around 12 core contributors
* Estimated cost of development: $ 2 millions
* Estimated effort: 37 person-years

# Contributions to scikit-learn at Paris-Saclay

# Loky

### Context:

* Doctoral mission (Thomas Moreau) funded by DigiCosme.

---
# Loky

- `Thread` can be efficient to run multicore programs if your code releases the **GIL**.

- `Process` for efficient multicore on pure Python code.

--

- Use `Process` with `spawn` and try to reuse the pool of process as much as possible.

- `loky` improves the management of a pool of workers in projects such as `joblib`.

# Loky

### Context:

* Doctoral mission (Thomas Moreau) funded by DigiCosme.

### Outcome:

* Important improvements in `joblib` and `scikit-learn`: e.g. enable nested
  parallelism, support of OpenMP
* Contributions upstream to Python 3.7
* Experience for people involved in the development

---
# Scikit-learn features

* `ColumnTransformer`
* `CategoricalEncoder`
* `MICEImputer`
* `PowerTransformer`
* `TransformedTargetRegressor`
* `StackingClassifier` and `StackingRegressor`

Aim: Features developed to enable baseline machine learning algorithms and
pipeline

# Software engineering best practices

Used in major open source projects:

- Version control (git)
- Bug tracker (GitHub)
- Code review (GitHub)
- Unit testing and Continuous Integration (Travis CI, Appveyor, ...)
- Code quality (flake8, ...)
- Documentation (sphinx)

how many pandas users?

website: 400,000 active users that come back every month

also scope becomes bigger

# Pandas* development

Main bottleneck are maintainers

* Reviewing pull requests
* Deciding on design questions
* Tackling bigger issues
* Infrastructure work (CI, packaging, ...)

High-quality open source software is not built on hackatons, but needs highly engaged developers

<div style="margin-bottom:120px"></div>

.grey[.right[.small[*The same is true for other open source packages]]]


???

to be clear: hackatons and sprints are great to introduce people to contributing to open source,
but that alone is not a sustainable way to maintain big open source projects

+ note: not to dismiss the many great packages that are actually build (initially) as an evening hack

that doesn't need to be full time

give employees that want it time to contribute to the packages they are using
